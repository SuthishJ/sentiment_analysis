# 📢 Social Media Sentiment Analysis 🗣️  
A machine learning model that classifies social media posts as **Positive 😊, Negative 😞, or Neutral 😐** based on sentiment.  

---

## 📊 Dataset Used  
This project analyzes **real social media posts** from platforms like **Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram** to determine user sentiment.

### **It helps in understanding:**  
✅ Public opinion trends on social media.  
✅ How users express emotions in different contexts.  
✅ Insights into user engagement across platforms.

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This model processes social media text data, applies **natural language processing (NLP) techniques**, and classifies posts into three categories:  
✔️ **Positive** – Happy, satisfied, or enthusiastic posts.  
❌ **Negative** – Complaints, frustration, or criticism.  
➖ **Neutral** – Informational or mixed-feeling posts.  

---

## 🛠 Built With  
✅ **Scikit-learn** – Logistic Regression for sentiment classification.  
✅ **TF-IDF Vectorization** – Converts text into numerical features.  
✅ **Gradio** – Interactive web app for real-time testing.  
✅ **Hugging Face Spaces** – Deployment for public access.

## 🛠️ How It Works  
1️⃣ **User enters a social media post** (e.g., tweet, Facebook status).  
2️⃣ **Text is preprocessed** (cleaning, lowercasing, and vectorizing using TF-IDF).  
3️⃣ **Trained ML model predicts** the sentiment (**Positive, Negative, or Neutral**).  
4️⃣ **Confidence score is displayed** to show model certainty.

## 📌 Example Output  

| **Input Text** | **Sentiment** | **Confidence** |
|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| "This trip was amazing! Had a great time." | Positive  | 98.3% |
| "I hate traffic jams. So frustrating!" | Negative  | 97.5% |
| "The weather today is just fine." | Neutral  | 92.1% |
